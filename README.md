# z-waste

A project created for the sustainability track of [HackMIT 2021](https://hackmit.org) conducted in September. The idea revolved around zero wastage of food thereby ensuring zero hunger.

Our team, comprising of four people from different parts of the world, came up with the concept of Z-Wasteâ€”a platform aimed at connecting non-profits to people in need of food. Once signed up on our web application, anyone can find other nearby users from their dashboard who either require food or have food in excess. We used [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/) to create a custom map for the dashboard. The application will specifically map non-profiit organisations to other individuals like farmers or grocery store owners.

Even though we did not create the entire backend logic of the web app, we tried our best to put out all the details in the judging presentation. The front-end of the web app was built as well. Finally, we deployed the React App on Azure, which was a major learning curve.
